Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As we begin the initial stages of the WhatsApp project, I am currently conducting a thorough requirement analysis to ensure we align with the project's objectives and deliverables. To proceed effectively, I would appreciate your assistance in providing further details regarding the scope, target audience, key functionalities, and any specific business goals or constraints associated with the project.

Having a clearer understanding of these elements will enable us to define the technical and operational requirements more accurately and ensure that our solution is both robust and aligned with stakeholder expectations.

Please let me know a convenient time for a brief discussion, or feel free to share any relevant documentation or insights at your earliest convenience.
