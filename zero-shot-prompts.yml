Dear Stakeholders,

I hope you are well.

Iâ€™m writing to inform you of a two-week delay in the WhatsApp integration project. We sincerely apologize for this change and understand the importance of maintaining momentum and meeting expectations.

The delay is due to a set of technical challenges we encountered during the final stages of API configuration and message routing. Specifically, we are addressing issues related to secure authentication and ensuring consistent message delivery across platforms. Our team is actively working to resolve these with minimal disruption to the overall project goals.

Revised Timeline:
The new projected completion date is Friday, August 1st, 2025.

Next Steps:

Finalize API authentication and routing logic by July 22
Conduct extended QA testing from July 23 to July 30
Prepare deployment and stakeholder review by July 31
We remain committed to delivering a robust and reliable integration, and we appreciate your continued support and understanding. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to schedule a progress check-in.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
